Hello Unity Developers!

After releasing my authentic medieval music pack, I decided to compose a "Medieval Battle" extension as there was very little music suited for battles.

In this pack you will find 3 OGG files that start off in a "Peace" atmosphere and transition to Medieval Battle music and 1 OGG file (medieval battle4) which is only for Battle.

*NEW* Now, all four tracks are available as seamless loops!

I have purposefully used only historically accurate instruments that you could find on a Medieval battle field: drums, flute, fife, shofar (a sort of horn) and bagpipe.
The overall feel of the compositions is that of having a small marching band by your side in Battle.

Check out the Lite and Pro versions to have more interactive diversified sets of loops for Medieval Battles inside your game!

Drop a comment in the review of this Asset and let me know what you think! :)

Thanks and enjoy!
